D7. Verification and Validation


# 1. Description
Provide 1-2 paragraphs to describe your system. This will help us to remember what your
system is about.


The problem of disconnect between students on campus affects students who struggle 
to meet people with similar interests; the impact of which is many of the students on 
campus feel disconnected from their peers and in turn will lose opportunities to build 
connections, this is especially true for freshman and transfer students. For students who 
feel lonely or want to meet new people with the same hobbies, NCSM is a 
campus-based social media application that allows students to find events occuring on 
campus, find clubs that catch their interest, meet students with similar tastes, and 
navigate campus efficiently and effectively. Student users will be able to utilize a variety 
of features including: creating a post, adding friends, joining organizations and clubs, 
and receiving information from faculty. Organizations will be able to create posts that 
provide extra information about their current projects and events. Faculty will be able to 
edit club pages that they are associated with and create posts that are shared with 
students that are associated with that class. The school that the different users are 
linked with will be able to remove any members that are violating the terms of service. 
Unlike NAUgo, our product will provide an updated way of connecting individuals and the 
university. NCSM is a campus-based social media application that helps students who 
feel disconnected from their university and fellow students to meet others with similar 
interests, and connect with clubs.


# 2. Verification (tests)

Verification aims to ensure that you correctly developed the product.


## 2.1. Unit test
A unit test is an automated test that aims to verify the behavior of a component isolated
from the rest of the system. For this deliverable, you should have automated tests for the
main components of your project. Provide the following information:
2.1.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests:

* Flutter includes a unit test in it’s IDE, where you can download the dependency for your 
specific code and test it correctly. In other words, we used the flutter_test package to 
perform unit and widget tests.  


2.1.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
* https://github.com/mdb435/NCSM/tree/master/test

2.1.3. An example of a test case that makes use of mock objects. Include in your
answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.

* This test creates a post with a post ID, then checks if the created post is 
initialized with a post ID. 
* https://github.com/mdb435/NCSM/blob/master/lib/widgets/post.dart
* https://github.com/mdb435/NCSM/blob/master/test/post_tester.dart
* This test checks if a user is valid and in the database.
* <link of user.dart> <link to unit test>
* <link of comments_test.dart> <link to unit test>

2.1.4. A print screen showing the result of the unit tests execution.

Test Case 1:

Test Case 2:

Test Case 3:

## 2.2. Integration test

An integration test is an automated test that verifies the implementation of a business rule
that involves multiple components with the goal of certifying that they work together to
produce the expected result. They are often performed in the same test platform as the
unit tests. Provide the following information:
2.2.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests:

- We were planning on using flutters built in integration testing as well. The integration 
testing is apart of the flutter_test package. The flutter development kit provides a large 
library to perform testing. 

2.2.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated integration tests are
located.
2.2.3. An example of an integration test. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the
test and an explanation about what parts of the system are being exercised by
this test.
2.2.4. A print screen showing the result of the integration tests execution.


## 2.3. Acceptance
An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the
user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested
without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:
2.3.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium, Katalon
Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.):
- Due to time constraints we were not able to implement any kind of acceptance testing. 
We were planning on using Katalon in order to develop our acceptance tests. Appium 
would be used to take care of running on a server. 
2.3.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance tests are
located.
2.3.3. An example of an acceptance test. Include in your answer a GitHub link to
the test and an explanation about the tested feature.
2.3.4. A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution.

# CAMERON
## Sign-up with your gmail account.
How does the sign-up process feel? Can the process be more efficient?


* Feels fine.
* It asked me to enter a username twice, which was kinda weird.
* Other than that, signing up was fine.


## Take a look at your profile
Edit your bio, is it easy to do?


* Easily found.
* It’s confusing, as you have to hit update profile, and then hit the check.
* If you hit checkmark first, nothing gets updated.


Log out/log back in.


* Had to guide the user to the logout page.
* Logging back in worked well.


## Follow a user
Is it easy to find a user?


* After you follow a user, they no longer show up on search.


## Take a look at the homepage/feed and navigate through it.
What are your initial impressions of the app as soon as it opens?


* Clean interface, but it seems crowded towards the bottom, where the caption is.


How does the homepage look/feel?


* Good.


## Post an image.
Is the process of uploading a picture smooth? 


* Current location is really cool.
* It would make more sense for the icon to be above the textbox.


How does the quality of the picture appear on your feed?

* Picture looks good, it’s a little distorted, but generally it’s good.

## Like a user’s content.
Does the application respond to you liking the content? 

* Yes

Are there additional features you would like to see other than liking?

* If you can see a preview of the comments without clicking on the comment section, 
that’d be cool.

## Comment on a user’s post
Does the application properly respond to you commenting on a post?

* No, well kind of. 
* Lets you post blank comments.
* Timestamp is wrong.

## Overview
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of our application? Why?

* Rating on a number scale is unfair, the things I don’t like are more along the lines of 
aesthetics. Font size is out of proportion.

* Headers are inconsistent.

On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the content flow of our application? Why?

* The feed works out great, again just the bottom tabs.
* Very impressive in terms of the time given, Instagram is much better
* Compared to Instagram: 5/10
* Compared to other college apps: 10/10.

## Additional Comments
* The users to follow button is obscenely large.
* Is there a way to make that just like an icon?
* It doesn’t affect the usability of the app, but it doesn’t make sense for it to be big.
* Back button keeps popping up which leads to the edit profile page.
* Timestamp issue: Posted a comment, but it says it was posted 7 minutes ago just 
seconds after posting.
* It would make more sense for search to be next to feed, activity log to be next to profile.
* There is no way to look at who you’re following, which makes it difficult to find their page.
* A google maps implementation to link locations mentioned would be cool.
* Confused about the intention of the app.
* More college specific things.
* Maybe every day it will give you suggestions for your area. Give preferences for what 
you like to do.

# JACOB


## Sign-up with your gmail account.
How does the sign-up process feel? Can the process be more efficient?


* The signup process was quick. Cool that it takes login information from google, making it 
quick and easy.


## Take a look at your profile
Edit your bio, is it easy to do?


* Yeah it’s easy and works as expected.
* Though the update profile → check mark seems a bit confusing, I had to try again to 
update my bio since it didn’t update.


## Log out/log back in.


* Logout location doesn’t make sense, I only knew where it was because you asked me to 
edit my bio.
* Other than that, logging out and logging back in is quick. Nice to not have to input any 
login information.

## Follow a user
Is it easy to find a user?

* Yeah due to the “Users to Follow” page, I was able to find my friends that are currently 
using the app.
* Perhaps a checkbox action would be better, just so I don’t lose track of who I 
have/haven’t followed.

## Take a look at the homepage/feed and navigate through it.
What are your initial impressions of the app as soon as it opens?

* The app looks clean upon first glance.

How does the homepage look/feel?


* The scrolling is very responsive, The loading time is little to none thus far.


## Post an image.
Is the process of uploading a picture smooth? 


* Uploading a picture 


How does the quality of the picture appear on your feed?


* The quality looks nice! 
* It seems to distort pictures taken straight from the camera.


## Like a user’s content.
Does the application respond to you liking the content? 


* Yep!

Are there additional features you would like to see other than liking?

* I think that viewing a few comments on the picture would be nice.
* But nothing else really. Perhaps a bookmark feature? But that might be too much like 
Instagram.

## Comment on a user’s post
Does the application properly respond to you commenting on a post?

* Yeah, but in order to see the comment on the post, you have to go from one tab to 
another to refresh the page.

## Overview
On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of our application? Why?

* 6, the display feels a bit too much like Instagram, but Instagram has it better here.

On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the content flow of our application? Why?

* 10, the speed is really nice when it comes to college apps that I’ve seen. It’s often 
frustrating to use an app that feels like it can’t even work or do the basic commands it 
says it can do.

## Additional Comments
* Bottom overflowed by 8.1 pixels. (Likely broke due to the amount of users suggested to 
follow, maybe use a more dynamic container for this field)
* This app overall looks clean, just a few tweaks here and there and it should be looking 
and feeling even better.

## Reflections:

  The posting and feed interaction features worked fairly well. There were some bugs 
going on with the comment section and timestamp. The changes that can be made to make this 
app more robust is mostly in part with aesthetics and small clean ups with the functions we do 
have implemented in our prototype. We are going to try and do some last minute touch-ups to 
our app before presentations so we can have a working demo ready for the class to see. 
  With it being similar to Instagram, the app was familiar and easy to navigate. Most of the 
actions were clear in the perspective of the user. Some results produced by the actions were not 
as expected. These errors were all noted.
  Our users liked the Google Login, as well as the use of the “Use Current Location”. Both 
features offered simple options for things like logging in to your account or showing followers 
locations on their posts. For what we planned out, our prototype goes towards our value 
proposition of offering a one-stop-shop for college students new to their university.
