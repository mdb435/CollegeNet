# New College Social Media (NCSM)

NCSM is an app being developed by a group of students at NAU. NCSM is a multipurpose app that is meant to bring students on campus together. This app will improve the college experience for students that struggle to connect with others.

## Getting Started

To run with the environment that our group is using, you're going to need the Android Studio's IDE, as well as the Flutter+Dart plugin within the IDE.

Fork the ___ file, then run it using Android Studio (with Flutter) and its built-in emulator.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
Ensure that you have Virtualization turned on in your system's BIOS. The setting may be called VT-x, AMD-V, SVM, or Vanderpool.
You'll need this for the mobile device emulator.
```

### Installing

## Running the tests

For Android Studio, you're able to run an emulation of what the output will be like within the app itself, so be sure that's all set up and it will run with output/display at each run.

## Built With
