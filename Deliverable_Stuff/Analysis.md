D3. Analysis


1. System Description



The problem of disconnect between students on campus affects **students** who struggle to meet 
people with similar interests; the impact of which is many of the **students** on campus feel 
disconnected from their peers and in turn will lose connection opportunities, this is 
especially true for freshman and transfer **students**. For **students** who feel lonely or want to 
meet new people with the same hobbies, NCSM is a mobile application that allows **students** to 
find **events** occuring on campus, find **clubs** that catch their interest, meet **students** that like 
to do the same thing, and navigate campus efficiently and easily. **Organizations** will be able 
to create **posts** that provide extra information about their current projects and **events**, 
**faculty** will be able to edit club **pages** that they are associated with, and the **school** that the 
different **users** are linked with will be able to remove any members that are violating the terms 
of service. Unlike NAUgo, our product will provide an updated way of connecting individuals 
and the university. NCSM is a social media application that helps students who feel disconnected 
from their university and fellow students to meet others with similar interests, connect with 
**clubs**, and navigate the way around the university unlike current social media applications.


The stakeholders for NCSM would largely be those who belong to three major groups, these are 
NAU students, the developers of NCSM or anyone else taking part in changing the app, and other 
social media apps aimed at colleges specifically, because even if they do not directly change 
the software, they will have an influence on the same population that we aim to please.


Below is a list of functional requirements for NCSM:


1)  Create an account to interact with others

2)  Provide a **club** tab that allows students to search for groups with similar interests

3)  Feed that provides **students** with information or **messages** that they find relevant

4)  Filter feed to seeing everyones **post** or a certain clubs **posts**

5)  **Calendar** showing **events** on campus and other information added by user

6)  Add/follow other users with an account

7)  Communicate with **users** privately

8)  Class schedule maps to a virtual map of campus

9)  View approximate location of campus transportation (buses)

10) Tab to find contact information for campus services


Below is a list of non-functional requirements for NCSM:


1) Security - The goal of security is to make sure **student** information is secure 
and cannot be accessed by anyone without the proper permissions.

2) Readability - Our goal is to make our code as readable as possible in order to locate 
and fix issues efficiently.

3) Maintainability - Our goal is to be able to easily maintain our code by using tools 
such as git. We strive to implement new features while making sure our system still works.

4) Scalability - Our scalability goal is to be able to use the same logic and code to be able 
to withstand anywhere from hundreds of **students** to tens of thousands **students**. 

5) Performance - Our app should run as smooth as possible regardless of the amount of users 
currently using the app. Our goal is to make sure we constantly have a stable version of the 
app running at all times.

3. Class Responsibilities



**Post** - The “Post” class’ responsibilities include:
  * Creating posts

**Student** - The “Student”  class’ responsibilities include:
  * Joining club
  * Changing major
  * Creating post
  
  We included this class because this is our main user of the program, who will be 
  interacting with the program itself.
  

**Faculty** - The “Faculty” class’ responsibilities include:
  * Updating the class page
  * Posting class info
  * Replying to messages
  
  We included this class because we want our user to have an all in one social media

**Page** - The “Page” class responsibilities include:
  * Deleting an account (Page Owner can delete their own account)
  * A page owner can filter their feed so that it only shows the things they want to see.
  * A page owner can block people from seeing the content that is on their page.
  * There is an edit page feature to allow for a more personal experience.
  
  This class was essential to the application because it holds the structure for the users 
  account. The user will use this page to post and see other posts.

  We felt this class was necessary for holding specific responsibilities that a club will 
  have over its page and the members associated with the club.

  * Use the Post class to create posts on their page
  * Create events using the event class that are important to the org

  * Getting the info from the user or group
  * Adding the event to the calendar
