D6. Implementation 2


1. Implementation 



The problem of disconnect between students on campus affects students who struggle 
to meet people with similar interests; the impact of which is many of the students on 
campus feel disconnected from their peers and in turn will lose opportunities to build 
connections, this is especially true for freshman and transfer students. For students who 
feel lonely or want to meet new people with the same hobbies, NCSM is a 
campus-based social media application that allows students to find events occuring on 
campus, find clubs that catch their interest, meet students with similar tastes, and 
navigate campus efficiently and effectively. Student users will be able to utilize a variety 
of features including: creating a post, adding friends, joining organizations and clubs, and 
receiving information from faculty. Organizations will be able to create posts that 
provide extra information about their current projects and events. Faculty will be able to 
edit club pages that they are associated with and create posts that are shared with 
students that are associated with that class. The school that the different users are 
linked with will be able to remove any members that are violating the terms of service. 
Unlike NAUgo, our product will provide an updated way of connecting individuals and the 
university. NCSM is a campus-based social media application that helps students who 
feel disconnected from their university and fellow students to meet others with similar 
interests, and connect with clubs.

2. Implemented Reuirements


NOTE: We as a team felt uncomfortable on how to submit multiple parts of an app split 
up amongst the team so we do not have multiple pull requests to show for each feature. 
We instead developed code locally and then shared the code amongst each other. Our 
quality assurance was performed by others during our meetings and if there were further 
issues, we brought it up to each other via Discord. Ethan compiled our code into a single 
file and then uploaded it to Github to ensure that we put out a working product.

4.Code Quality


Throughout our implementation, we focused on making things as modular as possible. 
Specific tasks were split up amongst group members based on the priority of the 
features such as user sign in, creating posts, and database management. In the prior 
weeks leading up to the implementations, our group discussed naming conventions such 
as variables, methods, etc. that we should uniformly use, as to keep the code similar 
across all files. Each group was then required to report the status of their implementation 
during our weekly meeting minutes. As a group, we constantly discussed our next steps 
for implementations of additional features. Each segment of the code was reviewed by 
the designated quality assurance members weekly and was then sent into the group 
github through multiple pull requests. As we continued to develop code, we refined our 
strategies for delegation and code management. 


5.Lessons Learned

In retrospective, we learned that implementing takes a lot more time than anticipated. It 
is easy to run into bugs and issues while writing the code for our application. If we were 
to continue developing this application, we would probably stretch out the timeline for 
implementing features so that we were not stuck having to try to create features by the 
deadline. Another lesson from this second release that we learned is how important it 
can be to build a team of different strengths. By having a team with a variety of skills, it 
probably would have been easier to split up the workload. We think that going forward, it 
would be important to identify what everyone on the team feels most comfortable doing 
and going from there.
